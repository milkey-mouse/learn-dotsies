**Coming soon!**

Learn Dotsies is a browser extension to help you learn [dotsies](https://dotsies.org/).
It replaces a portion of words on a webpage with dotsies versions. It starts with words that appear often in English text.
You can slowly increase the percentage of words written in dotsies until you can understand 100% dotsies text.

[Dotsies](https://dotsies.org/) was invented by Craig Muth.

English word frequency data is derived from [wordfreq](https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/wordfreq), which
in turn is derived from [Exquisite Corpus](https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/exquisite-corpus), which uses
[many different data sources](https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/wordfreq#sources-and-supported-languages).
